## Usage

The SASSA Web Scraping API exposes a single endpoint that allows you to scrape data from the SASSA website.

## API Endpoint

### Scrape SASSA Data

This endpoint triggers the web scraping process, retrieves data from the SASSA website, and returns the data in JSON format.

**Example Request**:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/sassa/scrape
```

**Example Response**:

```json
{
  "Data": "Scraped Data"
}
```

## Testing

You can test the API using various methods, including manual testing, unit testing, and integration testing. For more information on testing, refer to the [Testing](#testing) section in the README.

## Error Handling

The API provides error handling for cases where the web scraping process fails or the requested data is not found. The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
